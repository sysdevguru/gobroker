The Customer hereby agrees as follows with respect to the Account, which the Customer has established with the Introducing Broker for the purchase, sale or carrying of securities or contracts relating thereto and\/or the borrowing of funds, which transactions are cleared through you.  To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. In order to open an account, the Customer will provide information that will allow you to identify the Customer including, but not limited to, the Customer\u2019s name, address, date of birth, and the Customer\u2019s driver\u2019s license or other identifying documents.\n\n1. Applicable Rules and Regulations.  All transactions for the Account shall be subject to the constitution, rules, regulations, customs and usages of the exchange or market and its clearing house, if any, upon which\nsuch transactions are executed, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement.\n\n2.  Definitions. \"Obligations\" means all indebtedness, debit balances, liabilities or other obligations of any kind of the Customer to you, whether now existing or hereafter arising.  \"Securities and other property\"\nshall include, but shall not be limited to, money, securities, commodities or other property of every kind and nature and all contracts and options relating thereto, whether for present or future delivery.\n\n3. Investment Objective Definitions. \u201cCapital Preservation\u201d - a conservative investment strategy characterized by a desire to avoid risk of loss; \u201cIncome\u201d - strategy focused on current income rather\nthan capital appreciation; \u201cGrowth\u201d - investing in stocks with strong earnings and\/or revenue growth or potential; \u201cSpeculation\u201d - taking larger risks, usually by frequent trading, with hope of higher than-average gain.\nAll strategies involve various types and levels of risk, the most common of which are market, credit, inflation, business and interest rate.\n\n4.  Breach; Security Interest. Whenever in your discretion you consider it necessary for your protection, or for the protection of the Customer\u2019s Introducing Broker or in the event of, but not limited to; (i) any\nbreach by the Customer of this or any other agreement with you or (ii) the Customer's failure to pay for securities and other property purchased or to deliver securities and other property sold, you may sell any\nor all securities and other property held in any of the Customer's  accounts (either individually or jointly with others), cancel or complete any open orders for the purchase or sale of any securities and other property, and\/or borrow or buy-in any securities and other property required to make delivery against any sale, including a short sale, effected for the Customer, all without notice or demand for deposit of collateral, other notice of sale or purchase, or other notice or advertisement, each of which is expressly waived by the Customer, and\/or you may require the Customer to deposit cash or adequate collateral to the Customer's account prior to any settlement date in order to assure the performance or payment of any open contractual commitments and\/or unsettled transactions. You have the right to refuse to execute securities transactions for the Customer at any time and for any reason.  Any and all securities and other property belonging to the Customer or in which the Customer may have an interest held by you or carried in any of the Customer's accounts with you (either individually or jointly with others) shall be subject to a first and prior security interest and lien for the discharge of the Customer's obligations to you, wherever or however arising and without regard to whether or not you have made advances with respect to such securities and other property, and you are hereby authorized to sell and\/or purchase any and all securities and other property in any of the Customer's accounts, and\/or to transfer\nany such securities and other property among any of the Customer's accounts to the fullest extent of the law and without notice where allowed.  The losses, costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred and payable or paid by you in the (i) collection of a debit balance and\/or any unpaid deficiency in the accounts of the Customer with you or (ii) defense of any matter arising out of the Customer\u2019s securities transactions, shall be payable to you by the Customer. The Customer understands that because of circumstances beyond broker-dealers control, its customers\u2019 voting rights may be impaired. For example, if the stock of a company that another customer has purchased has not yet been received from the seller(s), then other customers\u2019 abilities to vote that company\u2019s stock could be impaired until those shares are received.  In addition, if the stock of a company that the Customer has purchased has not yet been received from the seller(s), then payments received by the Customer from the Introducing Broker, in lieu of the dividends on that stock not yet received, may receive tax treatment less favorable than that accorded to dividends.\n\n5.  Cancellation.  You are authorized, in your discretion, should you for any reason whatsoever deem it necessary for your protection, without notice, to cancel any outstanding order, to close out the accounts of the Customer, in whole or in part, or to close out any commitment made on behalf of the Customer.\n\n6.

Until receipt from the Customer of written notice to the contrary, you may accept from and rely upon the Customer\u2019s Introducing Broker for (a) orders for the purchase or sale in said account of securities and other property, and (b) any other instructions concerning the Customer's accounts. The Customer represents that the Customer understands that you act only to clear trades introduced by the Customer's Introducing Broker and to effect other back office functions for the Customer's introducing broker.  The Customer confirms to you that the Customer is relying for any advice concerning the Customer's accounts solely on the Customer's Introducing Broker.  The Customer understands that all representatives, employees and other agents with whom the Customer communicates concerning the Customer's account are agents of the Introducing Broker, and not your representatives, employees or other agents and the Customer will in no way hold you liable for any trading losses that the Customer may incur. The Customer understands that you are not a principal of or partner with, and do not control in any way, the Introducing Broker or its representatives, employees or other agents. The Customer understands that you will not review the Customer's accounts and will have no responsibility for trades made in the Customer's accounts.  You shall not be responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of the Introducing Broker or its representatives, employees or other agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Customer initiates a claim against you in your capacity as clearing broker and does not prevail, the Customer shall be responsible for the costs and expenses associated with your defense of such claim.  The Customer understands you shall be entitled to exercise and enforce directly against the Customer all rights granted to the Introducing Broker.\n\n8. Accounts Carried as Custodian. In some cases the Customer\u2019s account is being carried by arrangement with the Customer\u2019s Investment Advisor or Investment Manager, who uses you as their Broker-Dealer custodian.

Additionally, in your capacity as custodian, you will not verify the accuracy of management fees that the Customer pays to Investment Advisors or Investment Managers pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement executed between the Customer and the Investment Advisor or Investment Manager.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Customer initiates a claim against you in your capacity as custodial broker and does not prevail, the Customer shall be responsible for the costs and expenses associated with your defense of such claim.\n\n9.  Communications.  You may send communications to the Customer at the Customer's address on the New Account Application or at such other address as the Customer may hereafter give you in writing, and all communications so sent, whether by mail, telegraph, or otherwise, shall be deemed given to the Customer personally, whether actually received or not. Reports of execution of orders and statements of accounts of the Customer shall be conclusive if not objected to in writing to you, the former within five (5) days and the latter within ten (10) days, after forwarding by you by mail or otherwise.

The Customer represents either that the Customer is not an employee of any exchange, or of any corporation of which any exchange owns a majority of the capital stock, or of a member of any exchange, or of a member firm or member corporation registered on any exchange or of a bank, trust company, insurance company or of any corporation, firm or individual engaged in the business dealing either as broker or as principal in securities, bills of exchange, acceptances or other forms of commercial paper, or alternatively, that the Customer has obtained and will provide to you additional documentation which may include information required under FINRA Rule 3210(407) from its employer authorizing the Customer to open and maintain an account with you.
